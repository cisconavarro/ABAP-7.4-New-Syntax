I. the READ TABLE syntax

1. Read with index number.

  Before ABAP 7.40
   READ TABLE it_flights INTO ls_flight INDEX 1.

  From ABAP 7.40
   ls_flight = it_flights[ 1 ].

2. Read with index variable.

  Before ABAP 7.40
  READ TABLE it_flights INTO ls_flight INDEX lv_idx.

  From ABAP 7.40
   ls_flight = it_flights[ lv_idx ].

3. Read with free key

  Before ABAP 7.40
   READ TABLE it_flights INTO ls_flight WITH KEY carrid = 'SQ'.

  From ABAP 7.40
   ls_flight = it_flights[ carrid = 'SQ' ].

4. Read with more than one free key

  Before ABAP 7.40
   READ TABLE it_flights INTO ls_flight WITH KEY carrid = 'SQ' connid = '0026'.
  
  From ABAP 7.40
   ls_flight = it_flights[ carrid = 'SQ' connid = '0026' ].

5. Raises an exception CX_SY_ITAB_LINE_NOT_FOUND when the read expression failsg
TRY .
    DATA(ls_flight) = it_flights[ 1 ].

    MESSAGE "Read successful" TYPE 'S'.
  CATCH cx_sy_itab_line_not_found.
    MESSAGE 'Read failed' TYPE 'E'.    
ENDTRY.

6. The result of the expression can be assigned to a field symbol as well
ASSIGN it_flights[ carrid = 'SQ' ] to FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_flight>).
IF sy-subrc EQ 0.
  "Read is successful
ELSE.
  "Read has failed
ENDIF.
